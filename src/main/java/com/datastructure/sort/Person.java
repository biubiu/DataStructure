 * Description:   This class now implements the interface
 *                Comparable<T> from Java 1.5, replacing the 
 *                interface Comparable which is Java 1.4, which was
 *                the standard when this class was originally written.
 *
 *                The compareTo method changes to take a Person object
 *                as the input parameter, rather than an Object object
 *                which was the requirement in Java 1.4 There is no need
 *                now, to cast from Object to Person.
 *
 *                There should no longer be unchecked warnings when
 *                this class is used with the rest of the lab.
